# TODO

- Unified function to handle searches and paging, called by heatmap and front-end, that returns JSON array?
- External PHP function to create table header array? May not be neccesary if refactor puts this info in only one unified table generation function.
- Separate link next to IP for running whois on IP address
- Search interface should specify fields as parameter
- Multiple field searches should AND together
- Make function/object to decide if IP is excluded to abstract out the logic
- Return CSS to separate file
